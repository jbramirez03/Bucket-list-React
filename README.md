## Summary

This is a simple front end application that creates a list of activities you would like to do and have them color coded based on how eager you are to complete a task. This application uses react to render components such as the form to add a bucket list item, as well as the bucket item itself.

## Usage

In order to create your list you must enter the content of the item in the input field and select the priority this item has to be completed.
Once the item is added to the list you can go back and edit by clicking the edit icon on the right of the item block and a form is rendered to change the content of the item.

## Challenges

The main challenge for this application was passing in different functions as props to children components in order to successfully add, delete, edit a bucket list item. The next challenge that was encountered while creating this application was figuring out how to manipulate the state of a bucket list item from within a different component.

## Features

The main feature for this site is the ability to add bucket list items to a list and be able to edit/delete these items from your list aswell.

## Future Development

A route this project is headed is the ability to save a user's bucket list so that their last made changes are rendered once they return to the site.
